        ## Quickstart
        * Make sure you have ffmpeg installed on your command line, ensure ffmpeg is downloaded by running the command:
        
          ```ffmpeg```
          Which should give you an output with info on the version of ffmpeg installed.
        
        * Download the commandLineMusicVideo package with this command: ```pip install commandLineMusicVideo```
        * Run the installed package with ```python3 -m commandLineMusicVideo -h -t``` to view the help page and test your ffmpeg.
        
        ## Examples
        
        ### Rendering individual videos and a full album video for a folder.
        
        ``` python3 -m commandLineMusicVideo -songs "../../../Infernal Love/Violet Eves - Promenade [1988, IRA]/" mp3 "front.jpg" -fullAlbum -removeFirst 19```
        
        This command will get 'front.jpg' and all the mp3 files located in the specified folder:

        The ```-removeFirst 19``` tag will format the individual song output filenames based on their input filename, for example, the filename ```Violet Eves - 04 - Fiaba di Sale``` after having its first 19 chars removed, would be: ```Fiaba di Sale```
        
        After running the full commandLineMusicVideo command, the folder output (with all the individual songs AND the fullAlbum) will look like this:
        ![step1](https://i.imgur.com/xDm7Ps9.png)
        
        The output videos will keep the image's aspect ratio.
